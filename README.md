# FCCSurvey
This project is from the Freecodecamp.org curriculum, in particular the projects from the Responsive Web Design Certification. [Responsive Web Design Projects - Build a Survey Form](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/build-a-survey-form)"Free Code Camp Survey Form"

## Objective: 
The objective of this project along with the others in the [series](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/responsive-web-design-projects/) is to demonstrate knowledge in HTML/CSS- including Flexbox and CSS Grid, Responsive Web Design Principles, and Accessibility. 

## Project: 
I chose to do a lighthearted survey regarding the Black Card, a pop culture topic. 

### User Stories 
These user stories were presented by Free Code Camp as a set of  requirements in order for the project to pass the tests.
